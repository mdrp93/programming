//Solution:
//Write the number 1 next to the first line of code in this program that will execute.
//Write the number 2 next to the second line of code, and so on until the end of the program. If a line is executed more than once, it might end up with more than one number next to it.
//What is the value of the parameter blimp when baffle gets invoked? The value when baffle gets invoked is "rattle", and then change to "ping"
//What is the output of this program? The output in order is:  ik, rattle, ping zoop, boo-wa-ha-ha
