Exercise 1  
The purpose of this exercise is to practice reading code and recognizing the traversal 
patterns in this chapter. The following methods are hard to read, because instead of 
using meaningful names for the variables and methods, they use names of fruit.

For each method, write one sentence that describes what the method does, without getting 
into the details of how it works. And for each variable, identify the role it plays.

    
    public static int banana(int[] a) {
        int kiwi = 1;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < a.length) {
            kiwi = kiwi * a[i];
            i++;
        }
        return kiwi;
    }

//This method multiplies all the elements in an array and returns the result.

//The variable "yo" is a counter that increases in each iteration.

//The variable "kiwi" is used to store and sum the partial results of multiplying all the elements of an array. 
That is, the value of "kiwi" is updated in each iteration of the multiplication process, accumulating the partial 
result of multiplying an element of the array with the result obtained so far.


  
    public static int grapefruit(int[] a, int grape) {
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            if (a[i] == grape) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

//This method searches for the number "grape" in an array of integers and returns the position where it is found, if found, or returns -1 if it is not found.
//The variable grape "uva" is used to compare each element of the array "a".


    
    public static int pineapple(int[] a, int apple) {
        int pear = 0;
        for (int pine: a) {
            if (pine == apple) {
                pear++;
            }
        }
        return pear;
    }

//This method counts how many times the value "apple" appears in the array "a" and returns that number.
//The variable "apple" is used to compare how many times it appears in the array. It is the value to search for within the array "a".
//The variable "pear" counts the number of times the value "apple" appears in the array "a".
